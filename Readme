IUP Regression Model Readme
Author: Brian Auffarth

There are two ways to use the IRM (IUP Regression Model). Either you use the user interface through the command "iup_ui()" or just with the config.ini file.

Creating trends with the user interface:
1. Run the "iup_ui()" command
2. In the interface go to "File" and choose "Load Data" to load a netCDF file with the ozone data.
    2.1 If the netCDF files include variables of very specific names or the program can't load the data properly, go to "Settings" -> "Load Settings" and change the variable names to the ones in your netCDF file
    2.2 You can check your loaded data in the Diagnostic tab.
3. For additional proxy data, go to "File" and choose "Load Proxy File".
    3.1 Proxy data can also be checked in the diagnostic tab under "Proxies"
4. Choose which proxies to use and what kind of method should be used for them under in the "Options" tab.
5. Enable or disable an inflection point and put in a date for the inflection point.
    5.1 A green checkmark will show up if the date is in a recongnized format.
6. Hit the "Compute" button on the bottom of the interface and wait for it to finish.
7. You can now plot the data in the "Plotting" tab to see if everything looks good.
8. Go to "File" -> "Save" and save the computed trend as netCDF.

Creating trends with the config.ini:
1. Open the "config.ini" file
2. Change the settings for your trends
3. In Python use the command "ini = load_config_ini('config.ini')" to load the config.ini.
    3.1 Change the path of the .ini to the correct one on your system
4. Load your data with this command "data = load_data(ini, lat=None, lon=None, alt=None, time=None, atmo_parameter=None, name="My Data")"
    4.1 Replace "None" with your dimensions and variables
5. Load proxies "proxies = load_default_proxies(ini)"
    5.1 Load additional proxies that were specified in the confi.ini "proxies = load_additional_proxies(proxies, ini)"
    5.2 You can check your proxies by using "proxies[x].name" and "proxies[x].method", where x is an integer that defines the proxy order.
        5.2.1 You can change the method how each proxy will be used. For example "proxies[0].method = 0" disables the first proxy.
        5.2.2 The following 4 methods are implemented: 0 = disabled; 1 = singular; 2 = harmonically; 3 = month of the year
6. Compute the trends with all previous done changes with "trends, signi = iup_reg_model(data, proxies, ini)"
    6.1 This function gives out the coefficients for the trend and the significance
